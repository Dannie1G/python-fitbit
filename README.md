# Fitbit Data Analysis

This uses the Fitbit API python client implementation, which can be found [here](https://github.com/orcasgit/python-fitbit).

For documentation follow this [link](http://python-fitbit.readthedocs.org/).

For data collection, see the jupyter notebook named Fitbit_APIv12_DataCollection_gh.ipynb. __Note:__ I have hard coded the API_version to 1.2 in lines 23 and 190 of the original api.py file (found in fitbit subfolder).

More data analysis under way!
Happy to hear any feedback, ideas or comments.
